    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: 10th June, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>
      Dhwani (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy.
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and store personal data
      within our iOS app.
    </p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Full Name and Email:</strong> Collected during Sign in with
        Apple. This information is used to create and manage your account. It is
        securely stored using Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Camera Access:</strong> Used to scan documents and images. All
        scanned documents and images are stored locally.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> Allows you to select photos to
        create documents. All selected images are stored locally.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Face ID / Touch ID:</strong> Used for secure biometric
        authentication to lock and unlock documents on your device.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Contacts Access:</strong> Only your own contact card is accessed
        to display your profile photo (e.g., Memoji or Monogram). No contact
        data is stored or transmitted.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Authentication & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      We use Firebase Authentication and Firebase Firestore by Google to store
      and manage your account details such as name, email address, and user ID.
      These services securely store your data and are essential for enabling
      sign-in functionality and personalized experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      User information such as name, email, and user ID is securely stored in
      Firebase Firestore. No other personal data is transmitted or stored
      externally unless required for app functionality (e.g., account login).
      All scanned documents and photo selections remain on your device unless
      explicitly exported by you.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third-party
      advertisers or marketers. All data collected is used solely for providing
      core functionality of the Dhwani app.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Dhwani is suitable for users of all ages, including children under 13. We
      do not knowingly collect or transmit any sensitive data beyond what is
      necessary for app functionality. Parents or guardians may contact us at
      <a href="mailto:manasdevslopes@gmail.com">manasdevslopes@gmail.com</a>
      to review or delete account information.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Continued use of the
      app after changes indicates your acceptance of the new terms.
    </p>
